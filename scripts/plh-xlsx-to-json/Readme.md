# XLSX to JSON

This script takes input xlsx files and converts to a json array of sheet names, using top row to define key-value pairs.

Additionally it merges plh content_list metadata with flow data, and outputs a single 'merged' version for use in the app

## Instructions

`npm run xlsx-to-json`

This will create an inputs and outputs folder. Drop any xlsx into the inputs and run the script to get json in outputs
